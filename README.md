# Analyzing the laywers and teachers who donate to the FEC

__Disclaimer:__ This project [is meant to be one of several example projects showing how effectively and industriously we can use public data to do gender classification](http://www.compciv.org/assignments/projects/gender-detector-data/) if we don't care about statistics or real-world complexities or computational efficiency. It is not meant to be an actual study or a display of programming best practices.


Note: Results need to be recalculated...but the code pretty much works...
